# AgarioGame

## About the Project
This is C# .NET clone of Agario (see original <a href="https://agar.io/" target="_blank">here</a>) created for CS3500 (Software Practice I) at the University of Utah. If you are unframiliar with Agario, here's a quick description: A bunch of "food" (small circles)  occupy a rectangular space. A bunch of players (larger circles) move through the space.  Anytime a (somewhat) bigger circle significantly overlaps a smaller circle, the smaller circle is eaten and the size of the bigger cube goes up appropriately. Further, big circle can "split" in half, projecting part of themselves "forward"; this is usually done to ensnare smaller circles. Note: smaller circles move faster than bigger circles.
NOTE: I did not write the server code, students are only responsible for the client side code, which I wrote in it's entirity.

## Installation
NOTE: The client is not compiled and will need to run in Visual Studio to work properly.
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the AgarioInstaller_v4.msi to install the server.
3. Open Agario.sln in Visual Studio and run ViewController.

## Usage
In the Agario Client (ViewController), enter your player name in the name box and your localhost ip address into the server address box (usually 127.0.0.1). Click connect and you should be connected to a game with players generated by the server.
